# Hack-her-thon-2022

This project is meant to be an educational journey for myself and in terms of the purpose of the game.
The game is snap
However there are some education factors:
  We are not matching the same image but instead we are matching the image to the text.
  There is a plan to add counting to the game as well so not only are we matching words and images we are also trying to include counting.
  
 
 The current stage of this project is still at the very initial stages of having a display and questionable logic.
 Initally the idea was to incorporate image recognition to identify the objects and generate the text to match the image, however with limited time this hasn't been looked into.
